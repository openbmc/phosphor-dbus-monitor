  description: >
    'A path group is a named collection of DBus object
    paths and associated metadata.  These collections
    serve only to be referenced by other configuration
    directives.

    The metadata element has different uses depending
    on the referencing directive.

    Within a single configuration file path group names
    must be unique.  The same name can appear in multiple
    configuration files; however, the referencing directive
    will only search for the group in the same configuration
    file.'
