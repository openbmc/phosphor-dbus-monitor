    'A path group is a named collection of DBus object

    The metadata element has different uses depending
    on the referencing directive.

    Within a single configuration file path group names
    must be unique.  The same name can appear in multiple
    configuration files; however, the referencing directive
    will only search for the group in the same configuration
    file.'
